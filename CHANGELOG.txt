  when actually a username/password is specified. 
- Add fallback when server does not support server-side copy

- Fix "Invalid parameter" DOS error mapping
- Add one-shot setFileTimes operaiton (#233)
- Add ability to directly autenticate using NT hash (#235)

 - Idle disconnects will no longer break active resources (by default this means file descriptors), that behavior induced 
   a wide range of potential bugs, including broken file locks and race conditions resulting in SMB errors.
 - File descriptors are no longer magically shared through SmbFile. 
 - Every occasion where a file descriptor is used now returns a handle object controlling it's lifetime.
 - An optional mode (jcifs.smb.client.strictResourceLifecycle=true) to also prevent disconnecting trees that are still in use.
- Refactoring of SmbFile breaking it up into smaller parts with clearer responsibilities.
- Further refactoring for clean API/implementation split.
- Do not retry requests when there is no way they ever could succeed.
- Increased test coverage, fix some issues with legacy connections found through that.
- Change logging to use SLF4J facade
- Copy operations now use SmbFileInput/OutputStream and therefor can use LargeX
- Streaming enumeration operations
